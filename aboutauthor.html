                    <p class="body">The mastermind behind the RUMENUFF enterprise, Jack has always been a master of word games.
                    An exceptional scrabble player and a man who did cryptic crosswords and thought "I can do this, but
                    better".
                    For several years, Jack created his own 'quirkic' crosswords which was arguably several RUMENUFF
                    puzzle within a crossword.
                    Now a jump into the modern era, Jack decided to take his work digital and RUMENUFF was created to
                    share the scary insight into the mind of a MAD man.
                </p>

                <p class = "centre"><ins>Gerry MacDermott</ins>
                    <br><em>Production Executive</em> </p>
                    <p class="body">Of course the jump into the digital world isn't as easy as one world hope.
                    Nor is it as easy as someone with minimal coding experience would hope.
                    In this case of myself, Gerry MacDermott, Jack's grandson, filled the man's MAD mind with promises
                    of a shiny website (which I foolishly thought would be easy)!
                    Over several years of work (most of it procrastinating and an overseas holiday) here we are with
                    something functioning most of the time!

                <p class = "centre"><ins>Margaret MacDermott</ins>
                    <br><em>Assistant to the Creative Executive</em> </p>
                  <p class="body">No hare-brained idea would be possible without the help of someone like Margy.
                    If she wasn't involved this whole concept would still be chicken scribble on a notepad.
                    Marg is the glue that keeps the RUMENUFF train on tracks and I cannot thank her enough for; being the
                    filter for Jack's ideas, transcribing (and possibly translating) his writing to computer, as well as the general
                    torment that comes from being around Jack.

                    <br><em>Honourable Mentions</em><br> </p>
                    <p>Honourable mention to all those who have helped with ideas and testing and bug reporting, it is
                    greatly appreciated.
                    In saying that, you are all not honourable enough to get your names displayed. And too that one person reading
                    this who thinks they deserve a shout out as a "Sales Executive" keep dreaming (you know who you
                    are).</p>
